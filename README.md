P&amp;S Problem Sheet with Weekly Tasks, DA 2021

# This repository contains various weekly tasks of Programming & Scripting, as part of completing a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.

# Please see information on each weekly task below:

# 1. Github Link:
# Link to my Github: https://github.com/jonnygrealish64/pands-problem-sheet

# 2. BMI:
# BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight.
# The formula is BMI = kg/m^2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m^2 is their height in metres squared.
# Based on the BMI of the individual, it will print a statement stating the overall health of the person.

# 3. Second String:
# This program asks a user to input a string.
# It will output every second letter via slicing the string, in reverse order.

# 4. Collatz:
# This program asks the user to input a positive integer.
# It then outputs successive values of a calculation within a function.
# At each step, the next value is calculated by taking the user's input value.
# If it is even, it is divided by two, if it is odd, it is multiplied by three, and one added.
# The program ends if the current value equals one.

# 5. Weekday
# This program can determine whether or not it is the weekend according to the user's input.

# 6. Square Root
# This program determines the approximate square root of a number via the Newton method.

# 7. E's
# This program reads in a file and outputs the amount of any requested letter present in the file.

# 8. Plot Functions
# This program displays a plot of the three functions:
# f(x) = x, g(x) = x^2 and h(x) = x^3, in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
